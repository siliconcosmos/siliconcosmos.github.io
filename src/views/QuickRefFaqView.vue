                                <p>I am not a big tech company. I have no interest in tracking you or harvesting your data. I just want to help people learn to draw faster. QuickRef is free, because that will allow it to be used by the largest number of people. Many great softwares are free, such as Krita or Blender. QuickRef is not open-source like them, but it is still free like them. No strings attached. No tracking. You are not a product to me.</p>

                                <p>If you choose to purchase QuickRef through itch.io, thank you very much. That's very much appreciated.
                                However, I only ask that if you enjoy using QuickRef, please let me know! I wont know if you don't tell me directly ðŸ˜Š</p>

                            <template #content>
                                <p>On MacOS, tap-and-drag scrolling is not supported, because MacOS does not support simulated touch actions. Instead, your pen tip is treated like a mouse cursor. You can click-and-drag on the scroll bar to scroll the view.</p>

                                <p>On Windows, some tablets support the Windows Ink API. With Windows Ink enabled, you can use tap-and-drag scrolling to scroll the view like you would on a smart phone. However, because the pen tip is tracked like a finger and not like a mouse, right-click menus will not work normally. Use the kebab menus (three vertical dots) to get around this. </p>
                                
                                <p>With Windows Ink disabled, tap-and-drag gestures will not work, but right-click menus will. If your tablet does not support Windows Inkâ€”or you prefer not to use itâ€”there is a toggle in the settings menu to make the scrollbars wider. That should make it easier to scroll the view. </p>
